# *N*-ray Relation Extraction using Graph State LSTM

This repository corresponds to code for "[N-ary Relation Extraction using Graph State LSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09101)", which has been accpeted by EMNLP 2018.
This repository is still under construnction. 
I'll clean our code and write more details in this README file later. 
Thanks!

## Bidir DAG LSTM

Our implementation of [Peng et al., (2017)](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~npeng/papers/TACL_17_RelationExtraction.pdf), but with a main difference on how to utilize the edge labels.

## GRN

Our graph state lstm model
